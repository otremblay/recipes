# Chili

I have iterated my way to this over the last probably 10 years, mostly settled on a formulation that I like. You can use some of this for the Chili Mac pressure cooker or other chili recipes. Great fall/winter food

## Ingredients

- red pepper
- poblano pepper
- garlic (minced in jar is what I typically use, can use roasted garlic as well)
- 1 medium white onion
- 2 packs ground beef (2.5 lb)
- 1 can red kidney beans
- 1 can black beans
- ~1 jar of tomato juice
- 1 can fire roasted tomatoes
- spices:
  - chili powders (regular (lots!), chipotle, ancho, etc.)
  - cinnamon
  - smoked and regular paprika
  - cumin
  - black pepper
  - salt
- maybe a little red wine if you have it
- dark chocolate square or two

## Directions

1. brown ground beef with salt, pepper, cumin, chili powders, maybe some liquid smoke
2. meanwhile:
 - dice peppers / onion
 - put beans in colander and rinse with cold water
3. drain the beef fat into one of the now-empty cans if desired
4. combine ingredients in crockpot or on stove on low for like 4 hours.
5. Taste seasonings after a few hours and adjust
6. add dark chocolate toward end (1/2 hour cook time remaining?)

Garnishes:
 - Limes
 - sour cream
 - cheddar cheese
 - cilantro
 - raw jalapenos
 - raw or roasted garlic
