# Cumin-lime sweet potatoes

There's something about this flavor combo that is fantastic! I like to get extra lime-y and cumin-y with it.

## Ingredients

 - 2-3 sweet potatoes
 - lime
 - cumin, salt

## Directions

1. I usually microwave the sweet potatoes for a bit since it takes forever in the oven otherwise. Wash them, poke holes in them, and then microwave for like 5-6 minutes
2. When the potatoes are cool enough, cut them into chunks and put in a broiler-safe cooking vessel.
3. Add zest of one lime, cumin, salt, and stir well
4. Cook at 400 degrees.
5. When the potatoes are cooked through, add half of one lime juice to the pan.
6. Cook under the broiler. You're looking to char the chunks a bit. Stir once or twice.
7. When done in the oven, add the other half of the lime juice
8. Can serve with chopped fresh cilantro if you want
