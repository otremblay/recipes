# Frozen banana "ice cream"

If we get pretty ripe or overripe bananas, I like to cut them up into small slices and freeze them in a zip bag. Then when we want a frozen dessert, I take the slices and blend them in a food processor for a bit until it is a little mushier (using a utinsel to clean the sides when it's not blending well). Then, it's a great time to put in cinnamon/pumpkin spice and/or peanut butter, and I blend once more and it's ready to serve.
